first i introduced with web development when i was in high school diploma. and that time i learned html, css and javascript. and now after a long time i decided to take a serious jump and moving forwards with more area as well. 

so i purchesed a course from udemy and it's quite nice. 
here total cover 4 project during this course. and today i finished my project. 

now i'm try to add more features and build a my own portfolio. 

so in this project i've learned

- but in css part mostly introduce with fanta.css which is kind of prebuild code. 
- so html, css and javascript knowledge is mendotary
